# Vyond Legacy Offline - Installer

## What is Vyond Legacy Offline?
Vyond Legacy Offline is a project created by Fanimation36 witch is designed to bring back so many awesome and cool features like the preview window, old lvp, and so much more! all of this stuff runs under my github domain. so it's not really offline. i can say that it's designed to not be patched and keep lvm raiders away.

## Running / Installation
To start the installer on Windows, open install_vyond.bat. It'll automate just about everything for you and, well, install Vyond Legacy Offline. On your first run, you will likely need to right-click it and click "Run as Administrator". This allows it to properly install what it needs to run. After your initial run, you shouldn't need to do that again, you can start it as normal.

These are unaffiliated people that they haven't directly done anything for the project (and probably don't even know it exists) but still deserve credit for their things. Kinda like a shoutout but in a project's readme. ***Please do not contact them about Vyond Legacy Offline.***
